# Evolution of the MARGe


**Abstract:**
The MARGe project has undergone a significant transformation, evolving from a reactive graph animation tool into a comprehensive platform for the modeling, simulation, and formal verification of complex reconfigurable systems. This expansion not only integrated but also significantly surpassed the initial goal of a modal logic interpreter. Key contributions include the extension of the core Reactive Graph (RG) formalism to incorporate state and time concepts, resulting in Guarded Reactive Graphs (GRG) and Timed Reactive Graphs (TRG). The project also introduced advanced formal verification capabilities through a Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) verifier, enabling the analysis of properties over execution sequences. Furthermore, the visualization layer was completely redesigned using Cytoscape.js, transitioning from static diagrams to an interactive, dynamic simulation environment with semantic animation. To ensure interoperability and validate the formalisms, formal translators were developed for mapping RG/GRG to Guarded Labeled Transition Systems (GLTS) and for exporting models, including Timed Reactive Graphs, to UPPAAL's XML format. This evolution establishes MARGe as an essential tool for research and education in reactive and timed systems, capable of representing, simulating, and analyzing reconfigurable, guarded, and timed systems.
